<p>It is litterally my dream. I want to live in the era of this movie.(Interlinked)</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>NOLAN. ZIMMER. MASTERPIECE.</p>
<h3>Wolf of Wallstreet</h3>
<p>I had a dream once when I was a teenager, that dream was I buy a share of a company and years later I will become a rich. This movie changed the idea, dream of mine. In my opinion Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor all time. Literally I have watched all his movies. </p>
<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>I love the tension of this movie. Excellent acting. Good story. Hugh Jackman was a perfect father, his emotions was like proper father to who lost his child able to do anything to find his child. Paul Dono has breathtaking acting. I love it. He plays psycho roles at the top. </p>,
